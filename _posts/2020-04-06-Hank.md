Hank slept with us last night. Only the single seizure. One was enough. The vet found nothing in the bloodwork or the physical exam. We have no answers. The next diagnostic step would be a cranial MRI, which the vet did not recommend at this stage (even sans pandemic). If he has more, we consider additional diagnostics and medications, but the hope is this was a freak occurrence.

Today was my first day "back" at work---all non-essential staff are working remotely for the foreseeable future. Staying focused was a challenge, and I am spent after just nine hours. I have two proposals due this week. One that I've been neglecting during the recovery, the other landed in my lap today. Ordinarily, I would have spent a few hours tonight, after the kids were asleep, working on the proposals. But the proposals will have to wait until morning.
