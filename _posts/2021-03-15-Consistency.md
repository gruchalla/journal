Good to know that not even a worldwide pandemic can improve my journaling consistency. I have contemplated writing a journal entry now and then, but each day has begun to feel like the last. We've taken to celebrating minor holidays and anniversaries to mark the passage of time. 

Today marks an anniversary; we locked down one year ago.  Since then, Colorado has had nearly half a million known cases and over 6,000 known deaths. Each time we hope our cases and deaths have peaked, time has revealed the peaks as local maxima and small ones at that. Hospital and ICU beds have gotten constrained a few times, but Colorado has generally fared better than some other states. In our immediate circle of family and friends, we are aware of a few dozen people who tested positive and one death. 

We have been relatively careful. We've only seen friends and family a few times in the last year. Always outside, distanced, and masked. We have not eaten out at all. We have gotten take-out occasionally, but only food that can survive reheating before eating. The kids have had a few cycles of in-person and remote learning. The in-person learning is masked, the classrooms at less than half capacity, with the kids distanced (as much as you can keep kids distanced). It is undoubtedly our most significant exposure vector. Each of the schools has had cases and quarantined the exposed classroom contacts. But, to date, there has been no known transmission at the school. 

The virus generally seems less transmissible than we'd personally feared and prepared for. Michelle's mom even managed a stay in the COVID ICU ward without contracting COVID -- admitted for pneumonia that would prove to be aspirated pneumonia, not COVID pneumonia. However, the virus is evolving, and new variants appear to be significantly more contagious. We are trying to be mindful that our past success is not predictive, and we are doing our best to stay vigilant.  

Multiple vaccines have been approved and are being deployed. The supplies are limited, and the rollout has been slow. The state and county health departments are prioritizing high-risk age groups and occupations. All three of our parents have now received their first of two doses, although scheduling those vaccinations was challenging. Michelle and I will likely not be eligible until May. The vaccines have not been approved for children under 16 -- pediatric clinical trials are still on-going. It is not clear if or when the kids will be vaccinated. 

The monotony of days and the weeks has proved the most challenging and is emotionally wearing. One week feels like it blends into the next. We miss the small rituals -- Wednesday night basketball practices, the science fairs, the after-work happy hour, going out, and eating out. In retrospect, it is remarkable how much texture and meaning those small events add to our lives. We miss our adventures -- exploring downtown, spontaneous road trips, the small family vacations, and the big ones. We try to get out regularly to climb and hike and play in the snow. But many areas have been crowded beyond capacity or our comfort levels. Overall, we are very fortunate, and we try to be mindful of and thankful for such.  

Like most things, the last year has not been as bad as we had feared nor a good as we had hoped.
