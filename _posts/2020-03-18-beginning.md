The United States confirmed the first case of COVID-19 on January 21st. The first case was reported in Colorado on March 5th. Today, less than two weeks later, we have 216 cases in Colorado. The pattern repeating in China, Iran, Italy, and elsewhere through Europe is a doubling of cases every three days, and 20% of the cases requiring hospitalization. The numbers are overwhelming the hospitals, leading to cascading failures. 

We've been in isolation for just three days. Michelle and I are working remotely from home, as the USGS Hazards Program and NREL have opted to minimize the number of people on campus. The kids' schools closed with remote learning plans in place. 

I am going into this pandemic with "chronic appendicitis." Not the physical condition I'd hope for going into what may be a fight for my life. I thought I'd pulled an abdominal muscle a few days before Christmas. The pain would subside but return with any significant exercise. I saw my primary the second week of January and was misdiagnosed with a hernia. I do, in fact, have a small inguinal hernia. However, the surgeon, I randomly drew for the hernia repair, suggested my pain was very atypical. She agreed to more imaging, and a CT scan revealed a ruptured appendix. A ruptured appendix discovered six weeks from my first doctor's visit. The callous inefficiency of our health care system is maddening, obscene, and immoral; it is optimized for profit not for patient outcomes. The doctors were surprised that I had survived rupture, or had at least avoided the ER, yet there was no sense of urgency to remove the appendix. The calculus was they wanted to reduce the infection and inflammation before surgery. The CT scan revealed a fecalith, a fecal stone, in the appendix, which is the likely cause. However, the surgeon insisted on a colonoscopy before surgery to rule out colon cancer, and to help her understand which parts of the intestines might be beyond repair. This colonoscopy is a hospital procedure---considered high-risk since it could re-rupture the appendix. It is scheduled for April 8th and the appendectomy scheduled the following week of April. 

Neither are likely to happen at this point. COVID-19 is spreading too fast. While we (Colorado) have gotten isolation measures into place relatively early, our testing has arrived far too late in the pandemic (a failing of the wildly incompetent federal executive branch). The actual number of cases in Colorado is orders of magnitude above 216, and the Colorado hospitals will almost certainly be overwhelmed by April. 

We were due a global pandemic. And I am extremely grateful that this one generally spares children. I'm going to fight like hell not to leave them fatherless.
