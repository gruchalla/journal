I think we have gotten a little carried away with continuation ceremonies lately. We now have ceremonies to transition from pre-school to kindergarten, ceremonies to transition from kinder to first grade, ceremonies to transition from elementary school to middle school, ad nauseam. 

Tomorrow is the last day of the school year. This evening the fifth-grade class held a parade in lieu of formal ceremony in an auditorium. A line of decorated cars crawled through the neighborhood, with graduating students hanging out of car windows and poking out of sunroofs. I recognized several of the kids from the Math Olympiad club that I coached last year. It was fun, and honestly so much better than sitting in a stuffy auditorium, listening sentimental cliches. 

And it made me sad. 

I wasn't sad that these kids missed their fifth-grade continuation ceremony. I was sad that they missed a third of fifth-grade. I was sad that there might be a continuation of COVID outbreaks. I was sad that there might be a continuation of shuttered school buildings and online learning in the Fall. I was sad that these kids might miss the beginning of middle school. I was sad that there is so much uncertainty in these kids' futures.
