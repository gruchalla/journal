Iâ€™m out of the hospital. The surgery went well---they only had to remove the appendix. The surgeon said the appendix didn't look concerning, and the pathology report would be back in a few days. Since the hospital has canceled all elective procedures as they brace for COVID-19, I had the surgical ward almost entirely to myself, and I had the undivided attention of the recovery nurses.

The quiet before the storm was surreal. Like watching the shoreline quietly recede, knowing the tsunami is coming. I feel for what they are about to endure.

The surgical ward was isolated from the rest of the hospital. And the hospital campus is closed, only allowing patients and providers in after screening. Everyone I interacted with was gloved and masked. The intake nurse told me that Lutheran had only two (known) COVID-19 cases, isolated in a different part of the hospital. The exposure risk felt pretty low, compared to the grocery store, for example. 

Last night I needed too much support for a strict quarantine. We haven't decided if we're going to maintain the garden-level quarantine.
