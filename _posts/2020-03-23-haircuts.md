A couple of weeks ago, while I was walking the Walgreen isles collecting supplies (i.e., cough medicine, fever suppression), I grabbed a pair of hair clippers. Last week I tried something that I havenâ€™t attempted since I was five, cutting my own. I think it went better [this time](images/IMG_1273.jpg)---clippers instead of scissors was probably the key. I got a little too aggressive on the top and the back had has more of an apocalypse vibe, which Michelle has now helped me clean up. Yesterday, I took my second attempt, this time on Bryson. He claims he likes my job better than his _GreatClips_ cuts. Although staring at him now, I can see that I introduced some asymmetry.
