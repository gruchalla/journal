We are not sure what the hospital environment is going to be, but a hospital sounds like a real bad place to be during a pandemic. We have come up with a quarantine plan for my recovery. I will isolate myself in the garden basement, [walling off](images/IMG_1292.JPG) the guest bedroom and bathroom with painter's plastic. Michelle and the kids will still have access to the basement (laundry) and office. I can get outside through the garden walkout.
