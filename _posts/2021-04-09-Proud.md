The vaccine rollout has accelerated. Everyone over 16 is now eligible in Colorado. NREL working with Jefferson County Public Health has become a drive-thru vaccination clinic, immunizing over a thousand people a day. I was able to complete my vaccine course this morning, and Michelle is one shot in. The clinic has beenexceptionally well run and organized. I was proud to be an NRELian. The kids' timeline remains uncertain â€“ no vaccines have been approved for children under 16, with clinical trials for younger age groups still ongoing.

The virus continues to evolve, and questions remain as to how effective the vaccines are against the newer variants. And fears that the vaccine rollout is too slow, giving the virus too much opportunity to evolve around them.
