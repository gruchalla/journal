The second CT looked good to the surgeon and the radiologist. Both agreed it looked more like a typical case of appendicitis, and the surgeon was more confident that the intestinal tissue was healthy enough for repair. The plan is outpaient laparoscopic surgery. But if there is too much scaring of the large intestine or signs of cancer, she will be removing some of the colon, requiring being admitted to the hospital for a couple of days of recovery.
