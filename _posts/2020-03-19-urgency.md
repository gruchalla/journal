I have been off antibiotics for a week. I've gradually been having more discomfort in my lower-right back and lower-right gut. I have had two phone conversations with the surgeon in the last 24 hours. She is ordering a second CT. If that looks better than the first, then we'll schedule the surgery now, ASAP. All elective surgeries have been canceled, so there should be room on the schedule. However, if the CT still looks like "a bomb went off in there," she is holding firm on the need for colonoscopy to understand what the surgery will entail.

What are the chances of contracting COVID-19 during the hospital stay? My best guess is lower than the risk of the appendix becoming serious in the coming months, when there will be no medical capacity to respond. But with each passing day, the odds change. I hope the CT comes back looking good, and we can knock this out quickly. I hope.
