One week into recovery, and one week in quarantine. I'm feeling a little better, a little stronger each day. In the first few days of recovery, I had a variety of abdominal discomfort from persistent aches to sudden sharp pains. The only ones that concerned me were the pains on the lower right, needing the repair and any lingering infection to heal without complications. I have had no noticeable pain today. I took my last course of antibiotics this morning. 

We were going to break quarantine today, seven days in. The surgical ward appeared to be a low-risk of exposure, and the majority of COVID patients show symptoms within seven days of exposure. However, my voice became horse yesterday morning. After a hit of _Flonase_, it improved, but it still gives me a little bit of hesitation. We may maintain quarantine another couple of days. I'm certainly ready to hug my kids.
