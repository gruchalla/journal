Three weeks post-operative today. I'm feeling stronger, but I do get sore at night, my right-side oblique, which is a little disconcerting. Hydration is one variable I have been able to isolate. If I neglect to drink througout the day, I am much worse for wear by early afternoon. I've bumped up my hydration. With my nalgene bottle in hand, pushing to consume 32oz before noon, 32oz afternoon.
