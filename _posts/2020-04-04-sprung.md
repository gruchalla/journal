Day 9 of quarantine. The kids sprung me today, by [crashing through](https://youtu.be/VhWjGxsvaSA) our quarantine barrier.

For several years, Michelle and I have been talking about taking a sabbatical or a leave of absence. We have been looking for some way to spend more time with the kids while they are still kids. We've contemplated multiple options from year-long sabbaticals in some other part of the country, to taking months of leave to travel. However, the logistics are complicated between two careers, two schools, and ever-expanding extracurricular activities. Now that I'm out of quarantine and (hopefully) on the road to recovery, I see the COVID-19 shelter-in-place as an opportunity. We are in a horrible, shitty situation to be sure. This is not the family bonding I had imagined. I had pictured exploring the vibrant streets of a new city from our new center-city apartment, island-hopping across the Caribbean on a sailboat, or trekking across Iceland. But this an opportunity like no other (let us hope it is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity) to reconnect and hold each other tight. I intend not to waste it.
