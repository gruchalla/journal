Hank had a seizure today. I was enjoying my first full day out quarantine, taking my first shower in my own shower, when the kids burst saying something was wrong with Hank. He appears to have had a grand mal seizure. He had been fine all day, occasionally eating grass. While I was in the shower, he vomitted, began to cower, dropped, pissed himself, and began to seize. By the time I reached him, Michelle was holding him. He was rigid, wide-eyed, and foaming at the mouth. Within a minute, he was up with a panicked whine. We called the 24/7 veterinary hospital, and were told to see our regular vet on Monday, unless he seized again at which point we needed to bring him immediately. He seemed to fully recover after a few minutes. We inspected his vomit and poop, as well as the yard and the house. There were no signs that he had gotten into anything. Nothing new in his diet. A six-year-old lab, no history. WTF? I think we've had quite enough personal drama and trauma for this pandemic.
