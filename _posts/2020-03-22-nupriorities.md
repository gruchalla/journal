When the kids were infants and toddlers, they were so vulnerable. Every day, I'd would talk to them about their priorities. It went something like this,

> 1. **Keep breathing.** You have to keep breathing; you can only survive for a few minutes without breathing. You have to keep breathing, no matter what. 
> 2. **Stay hydrated.** You need water to survive. You can only go a few days without water. Make sure you get plenty to drink. 
> 3. **Sleep.** You need to sleep. Sleep is how your mind grows and how your body heals. You can only go a few days without sleep before your mind and body begin to fail. 
> 4. **Eat well.** You have to eat to survive. You can only go a few weeks without eating. But try to eat well. Sugar and fat can be delicious, but moderation in all things. 
> 5. **Maintain Healthy Relationships.** This is the hardest one of all, but the people we love are what make life worth living, the reason for the first four priorities. However, distinguishing good relationships from bad ones can be difficult. Here is a trick, a good relationship will never make you feel bad about yourself. A good relationship will simultaneously make you feel good about yourself and make you want to better yourself. 

Everybody, keep [breathing](images/breath.gif). No matter what.
