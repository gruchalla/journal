I am finally free of post-operative exercise restrictions. After being sedentary, nearly bedridden for months, I am weak, and my joints are tender and achy.  I am eager to regain my fitness.  For twenty years, rock climbing was my fitness foundation; although, in the last three years, I have not been climbing regularly. A shoulder injury derailed me. While I have been running and hiking regularly, they haven't kept me in the same kind of shape that climbing did. I've been bargaining if I can get past this illness and subsequent surgery, I will make fitness priority. Discharge instructions limited me to walking for the last six weeks. The surgeon's stated concern was an incisional hernia. I thought this would be restricting, but I generally haven't strong enough for much more than walking. I've slowly worked up to three-mile walks, and this week I'm adding agility and mobility physical therapy into the mix -- on-line instruction.  I still have some stiffness and soreness on the right side that has plagued me since the surgery, but I now need to stretch deeply to find it. I am looking forward to running and climbing again. 

The Colorado stay-at-home order was lifted this week. Businesses are allowed to reopen with social distancing measures in place (e.g., only allowing a small number of customers in the store at a time, and requiring masks). Many are concerned that we are reopening too soon, and we will experience the overloading of the hospitals that we've so far avoided -- no doubt thanks to the stay-at-home order. Even if the reopening goes smoothly, we're probably months away from the climbing gyms reopening. Many of the neighboring counties, particularly in the high country, are still discouraging or restricting outdoor recreation. We will stay and recreate locally for the time being.
