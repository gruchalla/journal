I had many phone calls today between the surgeon's office, the surgeon, and the imaging center. There was a great deal of resistance and bureaucracy, but I managed to get the CT scheduled for Wednesday 25th, the surgery could follow as early as Thursday 26th. All much later than I would like. By that time next week, I estimate there will be 1400+ known cases and 300+ hospitalizations in Colorado. Maybe we can get this done under the wire. 

The health care system in the United States is broken. Not broken by COVID-19, broken going into the COVID-19 pandemic. From the time I called my primary with abdominal pain until my ruptured appendix was discovered took seven weeks. A week to get into the primary. Two weeks to schedule an ultrasound, delayed while orders and authorizations processed. Two more weeks to get into the surgeon's office. Two more weeks to get the CT scan, again waiting for the orders and authorizations. 

Initially, I was in pain, particularly when active. The pain worsened and became exhausting. I was still able to hobble into work, feeling like a very old man, and would come home and go straight to bed. Mid-February, the flu ran through the house. Bren and Bryson both rebounded in a two or three days. Michelle had few days of fever, followed by a cough. I isolated myself in the garden bedroom, wanting no part of a cough aggravating my abdominal pain. I eventually came down with a fever, chills, and crazy night sweats. Followed by the most wicked cough of my life. On multiple occasions, I coughed until I refluxed. One week was awful, and I began to slowly rebound. Now some four weeks later, I'm stilll prone to an occasional cough. 

Somewhere in there was appendicitis. Somewhere in there was the rupture of that appendix. And somewhere in there was a respiratory virus. What was what we will never know. I suppose it was possible we had early cases of COVID-19. It would be nice to think the family immune. But the timing seems unlikely. More likely influenza, and I with a weakened immune system.
