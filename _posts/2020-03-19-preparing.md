We have been slowly preparing for the last several weeks. We have been making several extra grocery store trips, loading up on non-perishables (i.e., rice, canned fruit, canned vegetables). We were fortunate to avoid most of the panicked buying and madness of recent days. I have no idea why people think they need to buy so much toilet paper. 

The economic impact is going to be severe. I'm typically not one to sell stock, always with the long-game in mind. But we sold off about a quarter of our stock holdings to try and protect ourselves and give us a little operating capital. I tried to take a balanced approach, leaving my support and money with the market and companies that will need to respond to this crisis. I worry that I should have liquidated more. 

Michelle and I have updated our wills. We haven't updated our wills since 2009 in our preparation for a trip to France. I presented a paper in Lyon. Afterwards, Michelle and I took several days in Chamonix. Bren was only a year old, staying with Grandma. We thought it was prudent to have the guardian paperwork in place, in case a trans-Atlantic flight went down with both of us in it. We haven't really given the idea of both of us dying together much thought since. It still looks like a remote possibility today, but with both of us in our late 40's with underlying conditions (asthma and appendicitis), the possibility is all too real. Our wills now reflect that we have two children.
