This is a personal journal documenting the COVID-19 pandemic. I don't expect it to be of interest to anyone, except maybe my kids someday. I've never been successful at journaling, always losing interest after and entry or two. However, given the historic nature of this pandemic, capturing the thoughts and feelings of the moment seem more important than ever before.
